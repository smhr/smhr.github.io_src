### Star formation in filamentary dark clouds {-}

One of my current interests is to study filamentary star formation.

#### Gravitational instability of filaments using non-ideal MHD {-}

During my PhD, I studied gravitational instability of filaments using non-ideal MHD framework (under supervision of [Prof. Abbassi](https://s-abbassi.github.io/)). Because of very low degree of ionization in molecular clouds, it's not true to use MHD. In such media, due to the drift of neutrals in respect to the ions, neutrals can be affected by a drag force in a process which is called ambipolar diffusion (AD). I used Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich method to solve a system of ODEs with two boundaries that describes the global linear perturbation of a cylinder of gas in equilibrium state. See my publication page to see related papers.

#### Simulation of evolution of filaments {-}

I also work on simulation of fragmentation of filaments. In our group we use the [Phantom code](https://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/) which is publicly available and well suited for star formation simulations.

### Evolution of star clusters {-}

I'm also interested in evolution of star clusters, especially globular clusters (GCs). GCs are gravitationally bound massive stellar systems. Our Galaxy, the Milky way (MW) contains about 160 GCs [@Harris2010]. By looking at the coolest white dwarfs in GCs, the age of a typical GC has been determined about 12.7 million years [@Hansen2002]. 

Itâ€™s appeared that the the metallicity must be the same for all stars in a given cluster, but different clusters have different metallicity in the range of 0.005 solar metallicity to nearly solar. Moreover, they are population of stars that formed at the same time. So they are unique laboratories for unraveling stellar lifetime. I pursue specifically these topics:



### Initial mass function {-}


In my Master thesis (under supervision of [Prof. Haghi](http://iasbs.ac.ir/physics/dep=5&ef=en&page=personalpage.php&id=521)), I studied the initial distribution of stellar masses in a GC which is vital for tracing its evolution. 
Astronomers refer to this distribution as initial mass function (IMF). 
Since of similarity in distance, chemical composition and age of stars in GCs, those are by far the best stellar ecosystems to study the mass function (MF). 
However, dynamical evolution of GCs in addition to the stellar evolution, 
alter the shape of the MF and are responsible for generating various interesting phenomena in GCs such as mass segregation, 
core collapse and blue stragglers. In some cases, stars are stripped away from the GCs which have undergone tidal shocks 
and then can form extended tails around the GCs [@Kupper-2010-ID71]. 
So for extracting the IMF from existing MF and also delving into such phenomena, one should know about the effects of
these evolutions on the MF [@Baumgardt-2003-ID590].

### Size scale of GCs {-}

Distribution and number of GCs around host galaxy, could reveal valuable information about the host galaxy. So, it's desirable to investigate effect of host galaxy geometrical configuration and GC orbital shape on this distribution and size scale of GCs [@Madrid2014]; [@Webb2014].

Internal initial conditions of GCs are also have effect on size scale of them. It's believed that some GCs must start their evolution with degree of mass segregation [@Haghi-2015-ID586].

We took into account effect of primordial mass segregation on size of GCs at different galactocentric radii.
