Summary: Codes

Below are codes that I use in my every day scientific life.

### MOCCA {-}

[MOCCA](http://moccacode.net) (MOnte Carlo Cluster simulAtor) is an advanced very fast Monte Carlo simulator of star clusters.

### NBODY6 {-}

[NBODY6](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm) is a state-of-the-art collisional n-body code which I extensively use for simulation of star clusters.

### read-nbody {-}

[read-nbody](https://github.com/smhr/read-nbody) is served as a reader for output file of NBODY6 which is in binary format. It also performs some analysis.

### McLuster {-}

[McLuster](https://github.com/ahwkuepper/mcluster) is a nice tool to set up initial condition of star clusters.
