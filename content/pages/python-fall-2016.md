Summary: Python learning session

We decided to hold python learning sessions in our astronomy group. These days there are many python course around the world and I (as instructor) decided to use one of the courses which is more suitable for astronomy students. I found the [Heidelberg university course](http://www.mpia.de/~robitaille/python.html) one more suitable. It's lecturer is [Thomas Robitaille](http://www.thomasrobitaille.com/). 

I will gradually add some stuff which are appropriate for this course.
