Summary: Our second paper accepted.

After about one year, I came back! As my PhD study, I was working on "gravitational instability of filamentary molecular clouds". I've added the effect of ambipolar diffusion which is an effect happened because of partial ionization of molecular clouds.

You can find the new paper at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00139).
